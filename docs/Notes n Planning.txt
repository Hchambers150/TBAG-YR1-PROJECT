things to work towards:
 - map, rooms, etc
		store in an array fresh .js file / figure out how to get asp.net and js working?? seems hard
		room class:
			constructor(roomID, [connectedRooms | N,E,S,W], [chests / containers], "Description", )
- conversation mode {modifiers, }
- battle mode {health, equippedstats}
- read mode
- puzzle mode (and p5.js games) {modifiers (will that be possible?)}

			Stuck at the bottom, yet easily flies.
			Present in sun, but not in rain,
			Doing no harm, and feeling no pain.
			What is it? - shadow

			Answer:
			A mirror.
	- water jug puzzle
